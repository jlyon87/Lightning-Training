> This module will reuse the ContactTable from [01.08-diy-contacts](../01-my-first-lightning-app/01.08-diy-contacts.md), if you have not completed that module, refer to the requirements of that module to build the table now.

## ContactSearchResults

1. Create Component
	* Name: ContactSearchResults
	* Bundle Files: None
	* Attributes:
	* contacts, type Contact[]

Use ContactSearchResults as a UI Wrapper. We'll create a grid with manual size 2/3 of width. Within this, use fieldset and legend tags to partition this content visually from the Form above it. Within the fieldset tag, place the ContactTable - binding down the contacts attribute from the Container.

Check your work against /src/aura in this repository.
